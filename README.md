### 🕵️‍♂️ The Mission
I specialize in finding the narrative inconsistencies in secure environments. When the system says "Access Denied," I hear "Try Harder." My work involves simulating the villain's master plan so that the heroes (your security team) can actually win.

### ⚔️ The Arsenal (Tech Stack)
*Tools used to deconstruct the impossible:*

* **Languages:** `Python` (The skeleton key), `Go` (For when speed matters), `Bash` (Old school cool).
* **Operations:** `Red Teaming`, `Cloud Exploitation`, `Offensive Security`.
* **Environment:** Digital shadows, AWS instances, and occasionally a terminal that creates more problems than it solves.

### 🚧 Active Investigations
*Current plot lines I'm developing:*

* **Project Alpha:** [https://github.com/mauvehack/aws-s3-ransomware-sim] - *Simulating digital hostage situations so you don't have to experience a real one.*
* **Project Beta:** `[CLASSIFIED // DECLASSIFICATION IMMINENT]` - *Focusing on Lateral Movement & Credential Theft. Basically, I’m automating the part where I "borrow" your Master Keys and give myself a silent tour of the entire castle. Sleep tight, Domain Admins.*

### 📡 Encrypted Channels
If you need to signal me, use the following frequencies. No bat-signals, please; the electric bill is high enough.
